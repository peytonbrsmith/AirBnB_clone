## Project title
0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
Foundations - Higher-level programming â€• AirBnB clone

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to take the first step towards building a students' first full web application: The AirBnB clone. The first step is very important because it will use what is built during this project in all other following projects.

By the end of this project, students successfully learned:
- How to create a python package
- How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
- What is unit testing and how to implement it in a large project.
- How to serialize and deserialize a class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- How to manage datetime
- What is an UUID
- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to  use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function

## Code Style
All code follows PEP8 coding standards and Google Style Python Docstring Documentation.
